[ProX Code](#) combines the simplicity of a code editor with what developers need for their core edit-build-debug cycle. It provides comprehensive code editing, navigation, and understanding support along with lightweight debugging, a rich extensibility model, and lightweight integration with existing tools.

ProX Code is updated monthly with new features and bug fixes. You can download it for Windows, macOS, and Linux on [ProX Code's website](https://code.prox.com/Download). To get the latest releases every day, install the [Insiders build](https://code.prox.com/insiders).
